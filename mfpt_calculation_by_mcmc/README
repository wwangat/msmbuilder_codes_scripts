MFPT calculation based on re-sampling the column normalized microstate TPM, using markov chain monte carlo

better run multiple times to get the mean & std for mfpt

dependency: basic c++ libraries

mfpt_basedon_TPM_hardassign.cpp -> used for the hard clustering, clustering results as the input

mfpt_basedon_TPM_softassign.cpp -> used for the soft clustering, pcca+ membership as the input
