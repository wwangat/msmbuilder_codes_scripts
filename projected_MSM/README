Sometimes we want to compare different system, for example "widetype" and "mutant" systems using MSM. 

As the phase space distribution for different systems may vary, the MD simulation will cover different regions for each system.

Based on how we perform microstate state decomposition, we have three different ways to use MSM in this case:combined MSM, projected MSM and separate MSM.

combined MSM: combine trajectories from multiple-systems and then perform clustering. Then separate the assignments and build MSM separately

projected MSM: clustering for one system, then fit_predict for other systems. Then build MSM for each of them

Separate MSM: build MSM for each system separately...

ACTUALLY we can use other ways to study this problem, such as MAXIMUM-CALIBER (refer to:Volez Vincent, A Maximum-Caliber Approach to Predicting Perturbed Folding Kinetics Due to Mutations
