#IDEA AND CODE CONTRIBUTED BY PROF.FREDERICK FU KIT SHEONG

only when the input features for tica are pairwise distances

input: tica components (eigenvectors), PDB, atom_indices
idea: (1) initialize the pairwise distnaces using atomic distances in PDB
      (2) Propagate the distances using tica components as velocity
      (3) After each propagation, using classical multi-dimensional scaling to reconstruct a new atomic structure
      (4) Visualize the trajectory using VMD

After configurated the parameters, run the code by "python MDs.py"
